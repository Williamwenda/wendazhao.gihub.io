## Short Bio

Wenda Zhao is a Ph.D. candidate in the [Dynamic System Lab (DSL)][dsl], [University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS)][utias]. He is also a Postgraduate Affiliated researcher at [University of Toronto Robotics Institute][RI] and [Vector Institute][VI] (Toronto, ON, Canada). He received a M.Sc. degree in Electrical & Computer Engineer (ECE) from [Tongji University][tju] (Shanghai, China) in 2018. In 2016, he attended a summer exchange program in Robotics Technology at [RWTH Aachen University][rwth] (Aachen, Germany).
